NOTE 1 [file grompp.mdp]:
  rlist is equal to rvdw and/or rcoulomb: there is no explicit Verlet
  buffer. The cluster pair list does have a buffering effect, but choosing
  a larger rlist might be necessary for good energy conservation.


NOTE 2 [file grompp.mdp]:
  Setting nstcalcenergy (10000) equal to nstenergy (500)


WARNING 1 [file grompp.mdp]:
  You are generating velocities so I am assuming you are equilibrating a
  system. You are using Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling, but this can
  be unstable for equilibration. If your system crashes, try equilibrating
  first with Berendsen pressure coupling. If you are not equilibrating the
  system, you can probably ignore this warning.
